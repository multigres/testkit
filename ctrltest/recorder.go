// Writes in another namespace, writes against cluster-scoped objects (whose
// ObjectKey namespace is ""), and, on a controller-scoped cursor, writes by any
// other controller, are all things this cursor cannot see. So is a write the
// API server rejected: a cursor is accepted-only, because every assertion built
// on one is about what the operator did rather than what it tried. The one
// consumer that needs attempts is quiescence, through attemptCursor.
//
// Ownership: a Cursor belongs to one goroutine. The scan position is mutex
// guarded so that sharing one cannot corrupt the log index, but sharing is
// still a mistake: two goroutines racing on one cursor split the ops between
// them arbitrarily, which downgrades an ordering assertion into a partial one
// without any visible failure. Give each waiter its own cursor.
//
// Relatedly, the WaitFor* helpers take a *testing.T and call t.Fatalf, so they
// must run on the test's own goroutine. t.Fatalf elsewhere only ends the
// goroutine that called it, so a wait moved onto a background goroutine in
// order to "watch two controllers at once" reports its failure into the void

// can start after the op it was meant to catch: another controller reacting to
// what the first one just wrote gets its write recorded in the gap. The rule is
// "before the first recorded write in this namespace", not "a line or two
// early", since a cursor opened many lines early is safe and one opened
// immediately after the first write is not.
//
// Two independent scenario tests hit this before it was written down. If an
// assertion is about what a whole reconcile produced rather than about a
// specific next write, prefer Interceptor.Ops over a cursor: reconcile records
// are appended only once a pass returns, so they cannot interleave with the
// thing being asserted.
//
// Use this when the assertion really is about the namespace as a whole. When
