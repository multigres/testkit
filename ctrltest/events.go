// One goroutine per watched kind feeds one channel, so arrival order is
// goroutine scheduling order: two events microseconds apart on different kinds
// arrive in either order. The operator writes a PVC and then the pod that binds
// it inside a single reconcile, so without this an assertion about that
// ordering is a coin flip.
//
// This works only because resourceVersion is one monotonic counter across every
// resource here: one etcd behind one envtest API server. The Kubernetes API
// contract does not guarantee that and treats resourceVersion as an opaque
// token, so this stream is an envtest-only construct. Lifting it to a real
