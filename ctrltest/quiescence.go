// That last condition is not a refinement of the other two, it is the one that
// makes them safe to believe. Quiet is a rate measure and convergence is a
// level one, and exponential backoff pulls them apart: see Unconverged.
//
// This is the assertion a conventional "did it reach Healthy?" check cannot
// make. A controller that rewrites the same status forever still reports
// Healthy, so a suite without this passes cleanly against a hot loop. A
// controller wedged on a write the API server refuses forever is worse still,
// since it changes no object and so is silent on the stream; it is caught here
// because the write half counts attempts and not just accepted writes. On
// failure this names the fields that kept moving and marks the writes that were
// rejected, which is usually the diagnosis.
//
// Both halves of the window measure are required, and dropping either one
// makes this weaker than the poll loop it replaced. See churnMonitor for what
// each half can see that the other cannot.
//
// A quiet verdict has one seam on the write path, and it is worth knowing
// rather than trusting past. The recorder appends an op only after the API
// server has answered, so a writer preempted in that gap can have its write
// land after the last drain and still be counted quiet. The exposure is a
// scheduling gap rather than the length of a pass, and it is not a regression:
// the poller this replaced could not see a no-op write at all. Closing it would
// need a barrier between this and every writer, which the suite does not have.
//
// Bounding the level half just as honestly: it keys on a pass returning an
// error and on nothing else, so a controller stuck in a nil-error requeue
// loop is not caught by it. A pass that writes nothing and returns
// (Result{RequeueAfter: x}, nil) forever is silent on both window halves and
// converged on this one, and so reads as quiescent. That shape is a real way
// for a controller to be wedged, and catching it would mean judging whether a
// requeue is progress, which is the controller's own business rather than the
// harness's. A test that suspects one should assert on the object's
// conditions, or count passes via Suite.Reconciles.
//
// Bounding the write half honestly: it sees writes through a recorder-wrapped
// client, which is every controller under test and is not the data plane fakes.
// A fake looping on writes that change nothing would be invisible to both
// halves. That is a statement about the harness rather than about the operator,
// so a quiet verdict is still a claim about the code under test.
//
// It costs at least quiet seconds of wall clock even on success, so it belongs
// in tests about convergence rather than in every test.
