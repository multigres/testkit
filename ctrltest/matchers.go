// Which matcher belongs where is decided by the structure of the code under
// test, not by which one makes a failing test pass. Worked through on
// multigres-operator's shard reconciler, which runs fourteen write-capable
// steps in a single pass, the boundary is:
//
//   - Across steps, order is deterministic. They are sequential statements, so
//     the pg_hba ConfigMap always precedes the shared backup PVC. WaitForNext
//     is sound here and this is where the protocol assertions belong.
//   - Within a step, fan-out over ShardSpec.Pools is undefined, because that
//     field is a Go map and nine sites iterate it with a plain range. A
//     two-pool shard emits its pods, PVCs and PDB entries in randomised order.
//     WaitForNext flakes there; WaitForAll expresses it exactly.
//   - WaitForMatching, ideally never. See its own comment.
//
// One scope rule covers all three: the order-exact and multiset matchers are
// for controller-scoped cursors only. Nothing orders writes across
// controllers, so an ordering assertion on an unscoped cursor is unsound
// whichever matcher it uses.
//
// And the framing that makes any of this survive requeue compression: the unit
// of ordering is one reconcile pass, not wall-clock time. Compression means
// far more reconciles and far more interleaving, so an assertion anchored to
// elapsed time degrades as the suite gets faster, while one anchored to a
// controller's next op stays exact however many other controllers' timers fire
// around it.

// WaitForAll asserts that the next len(want) ops in the cursor's scope are
// exactly want, in any order, and nothing else. It consumes all of them and
// returns them in the order they were recorded.
//
// This relaxes ORDER and nothing else. "And nothing else happened" still
// holds, because the assertion is over a fixed count of ops: an extra write
// inside the window fails it, rather than being skipped over.
//
// want is a multiset, not a set, and that is the point. Two identical ops in
// one pass, two status patches of the same Shard say, need two entries here to
// be satisfied. A set-based matcher would accept one, leave the second
// unconsumed and invisible, and the next assertion in the test would trip over
// it somewhere that looks unrelated. The op log is an append-only slice
// precisely so duplicates survive; a matcher that deduped would throw that
// away at the last step.

// eventually-assertion.
//
// Three properties to know before using it:
//
// It cannot express "and nothing else". It is tolerant of extra ops by
// construction, so it can never fail because something unexpected also
// happened.
//
// It has a duplicate hazard by construction. With two identical ops pending it
// consumes the first and leaves the second in place, unremarked, and the next
// assertion in the test meets that leftover. That is a plausible mechanism for
// the original "two actions in one reconcile, waiter caught the wrong one" bug
// this whole pattern was added to fix, so it is worth knowing rather than
// rediscovering.
//
// It drops what it scans past. The ops it skipped are gone from this cursor,
// not merely stepped over, so no later assertion on this cursor can see them.
// They remain in the op log, which is where the failure dump reads from, so the
// evidence survives even though the cursor's view of it does not.
