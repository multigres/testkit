// KnownDefect exists so a test that has found a live operator defect can
// record it rather than land red. A red test in an advisory job trains people
// to ignore the job, so a known defect is pinned instead: the advisory CI job
// stays green while the defect is present, and the pin itself is temporary. On
// the day the defect is fixed, the same test flips red, which is the intended
// signal rather than noise, and the fix arrives as a commit that deletes the
// pin and replaces it with the positive assertion it was standing in for.
//
// A pin may also record behaviour that is awaiting a design ruling rather than
// a fix, and that variant expires differently: it expires when the ruling
// lands, either through the code change the ruling calls for or by being
// rewritten as a positive assertion of whatever the ruling declared correct.
// So "temporary" still holds, but the clock is a decision rather than a bug
// fix, and such a pin can outlive several releases while the decision is open
// without becoming a suppression. It is the executable form of the open
// question, and deleting it would erase the only artifact keeping the question
// visible. What is not allowed is a pin with no expiry condition at all: one
// whose own comment cannot say what would retire it is a suppression whatever
// it is called. The test of a good pin is that its own comment enumerates the
// changes, any one of which would retire it.

// KnownDefect pins a live operator defect. check must return a non-nil error
// while the defect is present, and nil once it is gone.
//
// While the defect is present the test passes and logs. When check returns nil
// the defect has been fixed and the test FAILS, telling the author to delete
// the pin and assert the correct behaviour instead. A pin is therefore a claim
// with an expiry, not a suppression, where the expiry is either a fix or a
// design ruling; see the header comment at the top of this file for the second
// case, which is the one that can stay live for a long time legitimately.
//
// check must return an error only from the assertion it is pinning, never from
// its own setup. check() != nil is read as confirmation the defect is still
// live, so a check that fails for an unrelated reason (a typo, an envtest
// hiccup, a field that got renamed out from under it) keeps the pin green long
// after the real defect is fixed. A setup failure should fail the test
// directly, before KnownDefect is ever called.
