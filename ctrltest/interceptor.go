// RequeueClamp is the ceiling Boot's interceptor puts on any RequeueAfter a
// controller asks for, and it is the reason a timeout in this harness means
// something is broken rather than that the system is waiting.
//
// A controller that polls out-of-band state on a one minute timer is right in
// production and ruinous in a test. multigres-operator's shard controller does
// exactly that while data plane members register in a topology store outside
// Kubernetes: nothing in the cluster watches that store, so no event can wake
// the controller early, and a converging shard sits out the full minute with
// every other test in the package queued behind it. Clamped, the same poll
// comes back in 50ms.
//
// Two things this deliberately does not do:
//
// It does not touch the deprecated Result.Requeue flag. That asks for a
// rate-limited requeue whose base delay is already in the low milliseconds, so
// it can never be the thing a test waits on.
//
// It does not hide the wait it compresses. Every compressed result keeps the
// duration the controller asked for in Reconcile.RequestedAfter, so a test can
// assert "the shard asked for a minute here" as a fact about the operator.
// That is a better test than waiting a minute for the same information, and it
// keeps the defect visible in an assertion rather than only in a runtime that
// nobody reads.
//
// Exported because a consumer's canary test on compression has to be able to
// name it: asserting that the harness clamped is a claim about this value, and
// a consumer that hard-coded 50ms would go quietly stale if it ever moved.
//
// One consequence is worth stating because it looks like a problem and is not:
// RequireQuiescent still works unchanged. Compression makes a namespace busy
// with reconciles while leaving it silent in writes, and quiescence is measured
// on projected state changes plus recorded writes, never on reconcile counts. A
// controller reconciling twenty times a second and writing nothing is correctly
// quiet, and a controller writing the same status forever is still caught, now
// by the write half directly rather than by inference from resourceVersion. What compression removes from that assertion is only
// the minute it used to spend waiting to start.
