// controller's reaction has
// already landed, and the change it missed then shows up as a step that timed
// out waiting for something that already happened.
//
// Open it on a fresh namespace, which is what Suite.Namespace hands out. The
// watch carries no starting resourceVersion, so an already-populated namespace
// is replayed as a run of "added" events, and those become the first step's
// problem: either permit that baseline explicitly or start from an empty
// namespace.
//
// Choose the kinds and the window with care, because a step's allow-list is an
// exact multiset with no "N events of this kind" wildcard, and there is no
// intention to add one. The rule that follows from that is one rule, not a list
// of awkward kinds:
//
// An exact step is sound only over writes whose number follows from the
// operator's code, and is unsound over any progression a concurrent actor
// paces. Declared against a paced progression it flakes on this harness rather
// than on the operator, which is worse than not writing the assertion, because
// it spends a reader's trust on a number nobody controls. Two instances have
// been measured, and they are instances of the same thing rather than two
// separate cautions:
//
// A consumer's own CR kinds. Measured in multigres-operator: any spec write to
// a TableGroup or a Shard bumps its generation, which sends all five of that
// operator's concurrent reconcilers back to re-stamp their own conditions'
// observedGeneration, and that cascade takes a different number of passes every
// run. One single field write, watching only TableGroup and Shard, settled
// after 19 events, then 13, then 9 across three otherwise identical runs.
//
// Pod status conditions, which is the one that looks safe and is not. A Pod is
// a plain core kind and its own creation and deletion are the operator's, but
// its readiness progression is not: DataPlaneSim (datasim.go) patches pod
// status on its own passes while a readiness controller writes its gate
// condition on the same object, so the number of status modifications a pod
// takes to settle is a property of that race. Measured in multigres-operator, a
// pod settles in three most of the time and four often enough to matter: first
// as a fourteen-event convergence step failing about one run in five, and then,
// after that step was replaced, as a three-leaf readiness settle on a single
// new pod failing one run in eight. The second measurement is the useful one,
// because it is what a reader who had just seen the first fix would have
// assumed was safe.
//
// Do not answer this by adding one more speculative Changed leaf. Nothing bounds
// the progression at the count you just observed, so a fourth leaf moves the
// boundary rather than removing it, and the flake comes back later and reads as
// a new defect. That file's answer, and the one to copy, is to take the kind out
// of the watch and read pods directly: a state comparison across the window
// catches every accepted write because
// resourceVersion is monotonic, and the operator's own write log
// (Recorder.OpsInNamespace, one controller at a time) carries the ordering
// claims an event stream was being used for.
//
// So the useful division is not core kinds against CR kinds. It is writes the
// operator makes because its code says to, which are countable, against
// everything another actor paces, which is not. Assert over the first,
// including over the core kinds a CR write produces; read the second, or use
// RequireQuiescent for it and for the "and then nothing else happened" half
// over the CR kinds themselves.
